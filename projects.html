              Fitegy is a social fitness app where users can choose or create
              their own workout challenges and send challenges to friends. Once
              users collect points through completing challenges, and can redeem
              these points for prizes and goods. Our product vision is to create
              a socially engaging way to stay healthy with friends. It can be
              difficult to find and maintain the motivation to exercise, and
              Fitegy strives to be that motivational gym buddy.

            <div class="font-extrabold">History:</div>
            <div>
              Fitegy began with the idea that working out alone may be difficult
              to keep up with for beginners or those motivated by others or by
              challenges. The idea was proposed by Alex Ko, Salma Hashem and
              Corey Dubin to create a social app that keeps friends motivated to
              stay fit.
